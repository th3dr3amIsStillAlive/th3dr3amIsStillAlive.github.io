Hi everyone,

The third week on my poker journey was a vivid example of the swings in poker. While the week had its share of smaller wins and losses, the standout moments came from a couple of key sessions.

The week had its challenging days, especially early on, but the real highlight was Friday's session. In a remarkable turnaround, I managed to secure a significant win, boosting my confidence and showcasing the potential for success even after a series of tough sessions.
