### The Study Session

Tuesday's study session was a time for reflection and analysis. Going through Monday's game, I identified key areas for improvement. Focusing on hand selection and emotional control were top priorities.

The final session on the following Saturday was a testament to the power of learning from mistakes. Improved decision-making and a calmer mindset contributed to a significant win, ending the week on a high note.
