## Introduction
What's up! I'm TheDreamIsStillAlive from Norway, and this is my personal poker journal. Allow me to take you on a quick tour through my poker journey.
### A Decade in the Poker Trenches
From 2007 to 2016, I embarked on a professional poker career that saw me navigating the turbulent streets of the **old school** online poker era to the newer and more **developed** theory based game towards the end of my career. My primary game was 6-max No-Limit Hold'em, where I grinded stakes ranging from 5/10 to 25/50. The majority of my volume was at 10/20. I was never a huge crusher, but did ok considering I played anyone, and particularly enjoyed the reg battles. 
### A Glimpse into the Future
In 2013, the poker landscape shifted beneath my feet as I was introduced to Game Theory Optimal strategies from an off-market solver. This was the point where my game completely transformed from being a **feel** based sinking ship, to one based on game theory. This glimpse into the future of the game set my mind racing with possibilities. At the same time, I began to wonder if there was more to life beyond the virtual poker felt.
### The Crossroads Moment
With a professional poker career that had never adhered to the confines of a conventional 9-5 job, I found myself standing at a crossroads. In 2016, while at the pinnacle of my poker career, I made a life-altering decision to step away from the game to pursue other things. Regret has weighed heavily on my heart ever since.
### A Surprise Win
While cash games are my main focus, I occasionally play tournaments too. After I stepped away from full-time grinding, I somehow managed to win the Norwegian Championship Main Event of Online Poker. This victory was not only a surprise but also reignited my passion for poker, fueling my motivation to return to the game.
### The Allure of Entrepreneurship
In the years that followed with education and a normal 9-5 job, I discovered that nothing quite compares to the feeling of working for oneself, of being the master of one's destiny. Poker, a domain I had devoted years to studying, held the greatest potential for me to create my own business. While I never entirely severed my ties to the game, I played sporadically, my love for it unwavering.
### A Resurgence Beckons
As I watched from the sideline that the poker landscape evolved with an explosion of solvers and accessible information, my intrigue grew. I embarked on a journey of rediscovery, delving into theory once again with GTO Wizard. My mission: to breathe new life into my old, out-dated GTO strategies.
### Rekindling the Flame
The burning question that keeps me awake at night: Do I still possess the skills to climb the stakes from NL100 and rise once more to the dizzying heights of high-stakes poker in this modern era?
### A Bold Challenge
My ultimate goal, if I succeed in this endeavor, is to return to the world of full-time poker, where I'll once again be the captain of my fate, charting a course in the ever-shifting tides of the poker world.

Join me on this riveting adventure as I document my journey, share insights, and chase the dream that has beckoned me back to the poker table. The cards are dealt, the chips are stacked, and the future is unwritten. Let's see where the chips fall.
