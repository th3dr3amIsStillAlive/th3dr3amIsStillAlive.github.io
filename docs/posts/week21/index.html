      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As we roll into week 21 of the bankroll challenge, it&rsquo;s time to reflect on the recent shift in my playing environment and the subsequent challenges that have come with it. The past couple of weeks have been a rollercoaster of transitions, adjustments, and resilience in the face of adversity. After nearly two decades into this journey, the learning never stops, and the battle against variance continues.</p>
<h2 id="transitioning-platforms">Transitioning Platforms</h2>
<p>Last week marked a change in the 100k bankroll challenge, as I made the decision to migrate from GG and WPT Global over to iPoker. The move was motivated by dead games and other reasons that I will not touch on now, but will most likely come back to at some point. The ability to use a HUD and have all hands tracked â€” a feature that has been missed dearly - is very much appreciated to be able to do again.</p>
<h2 id="facing-the-downswing">Facing the Downswing</h2>
<p>The initiation into iPoker was anything but smooth and the doomswitch was real. I&rsquo;ve faced a decent downswing, experiencing almost exclusively negative sessions since the transition. This period of adjustment has been challenging, testing my resilience and adaptability, although not at all unexpected. It&rsquo;s just that these swings are felt more when you&rsquo;re playing without proper bankroll management. In the spirit of perseverance, I finally broke the negative streak with my first winning session yesterday. It&rsquo;s a small victory in the grand scheme of things, but a much-needed morale boost.</p>
<p>Despite the recent hurdles, I&rsquo;m nearly breakeven for the year, up by about $600. It&rsquo;s all good. Sample size is small and it&rsquo;s all within expectation. If you read my <a href="https://th3dr3amisstillalive.github.io/posts/week18">Week 18</a> blog post, you will know that I am attacking this 100k challenge with pretty aggro bankroll management, so the swings will be felt a bit more, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
<p>On the strategy front, I&rsquo;ve dedicated considerable time to studying SBvsBB Single Raised Pots (SRP&rsquo;s) and also SBvsBTN 3-Bet Pots (3BP&rsquo;s). This focused study is already translating into a deeper understanding of critical spots and more nuanced in-game decisions. If it is interest for it, I could make a blog post going a bit deeper into some of it. Hit me up on Twitter or Instagram and let me know.</p>
<h2 id="adapting-to-bankroll-changes">Adapting to Bankroll Changes</h2>
<p>The downswing necessitated a couple of jumps down in stakes. After dropping below a $12k bankroll, I&rsquo;ve removed NL400 and NL600 and scaled back to playing exclusively NL200 stakes. This decision underscores the importance of bankroll management and the willingness to adapt to preserve longevity in the game.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The games on iPoker have been relatively good so far, offering a beacon of hope for turning around the negative trend. Tonight, we&rsquo;ll be diving into the Poker North Masters Turbo Event to see if we can add a black pair of slippers to the collection.</p>
<h2 id="graphical-reflection">Graphical Reflection</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the overall graph for the year, including all the profits from untracked WPT as well:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the year to date graph over the hands that are tracked:</p>

<p>The past two weeks have been a bit swingy, but that&rsquo;s just how it is. Transitioning platforms and navigating through a downswing have been a bit challenging, yet they&rsquo;ve offered rich lessons and opportunities for growth. As I continue to adapt and refine my strategy, I remain optimistic about the road ahead. The journey of a poker player is never linear, and each setback is a setup for a comeback.</p>
