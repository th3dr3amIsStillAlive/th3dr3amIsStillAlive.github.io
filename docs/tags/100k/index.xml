      <description>Introduction As we roll into week 21 of the bankroll challenge, it&amp;rsquo;s time to reflect on the recent shift in my playing environment and the subsequent challenges that have come with it. The past couple of weeks have been a rollercoaster of transitions, adjustments, and resilience in the face of adversity. After nearly two decades into this journey, the learning never stops, and the battle against variance continues.
Transitioning Platforms Last week marked a change in the 100k bankroll challenge, as I made the decision to migrate from GG and WPT Global over to iPoker.</description>

      <description>As the 19th week of my poker journey folds, I find myself in a phase of diligent progress and introspective learning. Embracing the 100k challenge, my bankroll has reached a healthy $15,497.00.
The Grind: Focusing on NL500 This week&amp;rsquo;s poker grind was concise yet impactful. On Monday, an hour at the NL500 tables brought in a $1,265 profit, while Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s mixed session of NL500 and NL500 ante games padded the bankroll with an additional $1,815.</description>

      <description>As we turn the page from the successful $10,000 bankroll challenge, I find myself at the threshold of a new and more ambitious endeavor - the $100,000 bankroll challenge. This week, not one to rest on past laurels, I&amp;rsquo;ve already dipped my toes into NL500. It&amp;rsquo;s an amusing start as we broke even, dollar for dollar, in the first session. The bankroll now stands at $12,291, marking the beginning of a significant journey ahead.</description>
