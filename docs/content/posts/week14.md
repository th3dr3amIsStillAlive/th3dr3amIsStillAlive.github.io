This week we had kind of low volume again. Christmas is getting closer, which means there will be more time to grind. Hopefully we can get in some good volume then. Figured it was about time to show the full graph of the challenge so far here on the blog. 

### The Weekly Roundup

Here's how the numbers stacked up for the week:

```
