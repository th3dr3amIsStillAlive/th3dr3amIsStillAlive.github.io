Hey, 

Week 7 was a rollercoaster, highlighted by the first real shot at a permanent jump in stakes. After a strong start on Monday, boosting my bankroll to $5,100, I took the plunge into the NL200 waters.

The initial dive was promising, with decent wins signaling a good start. However, poker's unpredictable nature struck hard on Thursday. A hefty loss at NL200 forced a retreat back to the familiar grounds of NL100. It was a stark reminder of the game's volatility and the need for bankroll management.

This week wasn't just about the numbers; it was a valuable lesson in adapting and responding to the ebb and flow of poker.
