Hey everyone,

Week 5 was like a ghost town at the poker tables – almost no action. Hit the grind just twice, keeping it short and sweet.

Tuesday was a bit of a downer at NL100 ante, dropping $185. But Thursday flipped the script. Jumped into a mix of NL100 and NL200 ante and came out $855 up – all in just a 0.60-hour session.

```
| Date       | Weekday  | Topic | Hours | Stakes                | Profit session |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ----- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| 2023-10-10 | Tuesday  | Grind | 1.25  | NL100 ante            | -$185.00       |
| 2023-10-12 | Thursday | Grind | 0.60  | NL100 ante/NL200 ante | $855.00        |
| Totals     |          |       | 1.85  |                       | $670.00        |
```
Total playtime barely touched 2 hours, yet walked away with $670 in the green. This week was more about laying low, a quiet spell in the ever-turning wheel of poker.

Stay tuned for what's next,

This week was all about making each hand count.

Keep grinding smart, folks,
