Hey everyone,

This week marked the beginning of my poker comeback journey, and let’s just say it’s been a rollercoaster already. I kicked off with a $1,000 deposit, ready to dive back into the grind. But poker, as always, had its own plans.

During my second session, the cards didn’t fall my way. I ended up losing five buy-ins, a setback that definitely tested my resolve. Not one to back down, I jumped into the next session hoping to turn things around. However, luck wasn’t on my side, and I dropped another three buy-ins.

At this point, I decided to deposit an additional $1,000. This was crucial for me to keep multi-tabling, a strategy I’m comfortable with. But as the week progressed, the downswing continued, and I found myself closing the week about $1,000 down.
