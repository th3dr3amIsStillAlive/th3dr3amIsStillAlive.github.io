## $10 000 Bankroll Challenge Overview
To start things off with the new blog and my comeback to poker, I will do the good ol' $10 000 bankroll challenge. The main reason behind doing this is that it gives me motivation since I would be grinding towards a specific goal.  

- **Starting Bankroll**: $1000
- **Goal**: Progressively move up in poker stakes to build the bankroll to $10000.

I guess it is not a fully valid 10k challenge to the purists, since I will be starting with a decently sized bankroll. But, I am not interested in playing any lower than NL$100, and want to minimize likelihood of re-deposits, so that's just how it is going to be `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

### Stakes and Bankroll Management Plan
1. **Initial Stage - NL$100**:
    - Start at NL$100.
    - Play at this level until the bankroll reaches $5000.
    - If I bust the $1000 roll, I will reload and continue at NL$100.
2. **First Progression - NL$200**:
    - Upon reaching a bankroll of $5000, take a $1000 shot (5 buy-ins) at NL$200.
    - If successful, continue at NL$200; if not, return to NL$100 until bankroll rebuilds to $5000.
3. **Second Progression - NL$400**:
    - When the bankroll hits $8000, take a $2000 shot (5 buy-ins) at NL$400.
    - Continue at NL$400 if successful; if the shot fails, drop back to NL$200 when the bankroll reaches $6000.
4. **Final Push - NL$500**:
    - At a $9000 bankroll, start mixing in games at NL$500.
    - Remain at these stakes until reaching the $10000 goal.
    - If the bankroll drops to $6000 at any point, move down to NL$200.
### Key Strategy
- The challenge strategically involves moving up and down in stakes based on the bankroll size.
- This disciplined approach ensures that the risk is managed effectively while aiming for the $10000 target.
- The plan is designed to balance the potential for growth with the need to minimize significant losses.

This structured approach to bankroll management is essential in professional poker, as it helps in mitigating risks while allowing for upward mobility in stakes as your bankroll grows. So, yeah - let's see how it goes!
