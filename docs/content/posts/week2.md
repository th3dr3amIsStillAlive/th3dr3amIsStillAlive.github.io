Hi everyone,

Week 2 on my poker journey was a lesson in steadiness and patience. I focused mainly on NL100 ante games, navigating the normal ebbs and flows typical at these stakes. This week was a blend of ups and downs, but nothing too dramatic, as the swings were relatively small considering the buy-ins.

I balanced my time between playing and studying, aiming to refine my approach and decision-making. The week ended with an overall modest loss, but it's all part of the process at this stage. These low-stakes games are proving to be a good testing ground for my strategies.

Looking forward to the next week with a clear mind and a steady hand.

Until next time,
