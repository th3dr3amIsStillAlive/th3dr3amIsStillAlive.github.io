What's up, peeps

Week 4 was a textbook case of "less is more." Dropped the playing hours but upped the game quality. Started with a solid study session in GTOWizard on Monday to sharpen the edges.

Only hit the tables two days this week, but those sessions went very well. Wednesday was a killer day at NL100 ante, locking in a sweet $677 in just over an hour, followed by a steady $50 in the next session. Rounded off Saturday with a decent $117 over a 2.5-hour grind.

This week was all about making each hand count.

Keep grinding smart, folks,
