description: Former poker player trying to make it yet again
---

As a former professional poker player, I am embarking on a comeback journey to see if the dream of making it in poker in 2023 and beyond is still possible. My initial challenge is to complete a $10 000 bankroll challenge - but that is just the beginning. If I conquer this first milestone, I will still continue chronicling my journey back to the high-stakes poker scene. Join me for consistent updates and weekly blog posts, offering a glimpse into the real swings of a dedicated player. Follow my journey as I strive to re-establish myself at the online high-stakes tables to find out: Is the online poker dream still alive and well in today's games?
