Welcome to the blog of TheDreamIsStillAlive, a former professional poker player from Norway. 
### My Story
After a decade-long career (2007-2016) in online poker, I decided to step away from the tables to explore new horizons. My adventures led me through the realms of education and a conventional 9-5 job, but the allure of poker never faded. Even during my hiatus, I managed to claim an unexpected victory at the Norwegian Championship Main Event of Online Poker, reigniting my passion for the game.
### The Comeback
Now, I stand at the precipice of a comeback. Armed with renewed motivation, I'm embarking on a $10k bankroll challenge. This journey isn't just about reclaiming my place at the high-stakes tables; it's about proving to myself and the world that the dream I once lived is still within reach.
### Beyond the Felt
But there's more to me than just poker. I'm a tech enthusiast, a self-taught coder, and an aspiring entrepreneur. These skills and passions interweave with my poker experience, opening doors to exciting possibilities in the digital world we live in today.
### Join My Journey
Through this blog, I invite you to join me as I navigate the complexities of poker and life. Expect honest insights, real-time updates, and a deep dive into the mind of a player on a mission. Whether you're a poker enthusiast, a fellow dreamer, or just curious about where this journey leads, there's a seat at the table for you.
